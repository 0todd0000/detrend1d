# detrend1d
Inter- and intra-cycle detrending of univariate time series.

Similar to [scipy.signal.detrend](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.detrend.html), **detrend1d** offers detrending functionality for univariate time series. Unlike [scipy.signal.detrend](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.detrend.html), **detrend1d** supports "intra-cycle" detrending, wherein the trend can (and generally does) vary over the cycle.

Refer to the notebooks for an overview of the inter- and intra-cycle detrending functionality that **detrend1d** supports.
